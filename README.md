## About me

I'm a solution architect and developer based in Texas, USA, with a strong focus on cloud-native architectures, distributed systems, and automation. I believe in building tools and solutions that don't just stay locked inside corporate wallsâ€”open source accelerates innovation, and when you share, you always get more in return.

My experience spans AWS and Azure, modern application stacks, and database-driven solutions, blending serverless, microservices, and DevOps practices. I work across multiple languages and frameworks (absolute favorites - Go, Node.js, TypeScript, React) and apply Infrastructure as Code, CI/CD pipelines, and orchestration tools to deliver scalable, maintainable systems.

With a background in enterprise platforms and over a decade of solving complex integration challenges, I bring a full-stack perspective that includes application development, cloud infrastructure, and database technologies.
